# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a dataset using Python. EDA helps in understanding the structure, patterns, and insights of the dataset through data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis.

We are analyzing **Diwali Sales Data** to determine shopping trends and spending behavior. Key findings include:
- **Female buyers are more than male buyers.**
- **Women have spent more money than men.**
- **Most buyers are in the age group of 26-35, and they have spent the most money, with women leading the spending.**
- **Most orders and total sales/amount come from Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka.**
- **Married women aged 26-35 from UP, Maharashtra, and Karnataka, working in IT, Healthcare, and Aviation, are more likely to buy products from Food, Clothing, and Electronics categories.**

## 📂 Repository Structure
- `eda.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook containing the full EDA process.
- `data/` → Folder containing the dataset (if applicable).
- `images/` → Visualizations generated during EDA.
- `README.md` → Project documentation.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for data visualization
- **NumPy** for numerical operations
- **Scikit-learn** (if preprocessing or feature engineering is included)

## 📊 Key Analysis Steps
1. **Loading the Dataset**
2. **Handling Missing Values**
3. **Descriptive Statistics**
4. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
5. **Univariate & Bivariate Analysis**
6. **Correlation Analysis**
7. **Data Visualization**
8. **Key Insights & Findings**
